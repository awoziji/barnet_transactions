## Executive Summary

In response to a request from an auditor, we reviewed corporate credit card transactions for the London borough of Barnet for the period 2014-2016. We performed several kinds of analysis: summary, trend analysis, classification review, clustering, and anomaly identification. Data quality was reasonble, so we were able to fulfill all of the analysis requests. The rest of this report will review the analysis in detail. The analysis requests and key findings are summarized below.

Analysis Requests
Quarterly summary charts and tables for each service area, including transaction counts and averages.
Significant changes in spending behvior by service area and by account, including both spikes and permanent changes.
Identification of inconsistent creditor classification to accounts.
Grouping service areas by spending behavior, specifically transaction count and average transaction amount.
Identification of several hundred anomalous or unusual transactions, including at least five transactions from each service area.

Key Findings
75% of creditors are classified consistently, but 25% are classified inconsistently.
16 spikes occurred in quarterly spending by the 23 service areas, as well as 42 such spikes for the 64 accounts.
13 permanent increases occurred in quarterly spending by service area, as well as 25 such increases by account.
Service areas cluster naturally into four groups, on the basis of transaction count and average transaction amount.
Approximately 330 or 3.5% of transactions are anomalous for high transaction amounts (above the 98th percentile for their service areas)
Approximately 90 or 0.9% of transactions are anomalous as one-time charges to an account within a given service area (which might represent misconduct or misclassification)
